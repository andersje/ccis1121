Using that datafile, you can complete all questions on this worksheet.  Write the correct answer after each question.</p>
<ol class='worksheet'>

<li>using grep, pick out all the lines containing 134.29 from the sample file:<p /><br /></li>
<li>Invert the answer to the above question.  That is, pick out all the lines which do NOT contain 134.29<br /><p /></li>
<li>Now display all lines which contain the word <span class='unix'>work</span>:<br /><p /></li>
<li>Now display all lines which contain the word <span class='unix'>server</span>:<br /><p /></li>
<li>Display all the lines which contain the word <span class='unix'>workstation</span>:<br /><p /></li>
<li>If the answers to #6 and #8 did not produce the same result, explain why:<br /> <p /><br /></li>
<li>(3 points) What 3 symbols redirect standard output (also known as STDOUT)?  <br /><p /></li>
<li>Using a pipe, alter the answer to #6 such that it is sorted by the first column<br /><p /></li>
<li>Using a pipe, alter the answer to #6 such that it is sorted numerically by the second column<br /><p /></li>
<li>Using a pipe, alter the answer to #6 such that it is reverse sorted numerically (that is, 5 would come before 4) by the third column<br /><p /></li>
<li>remove all duplicate entries from the answer to the previous question:<br /><p /></li>
<li>Use awk to display the first two columns of data from the datafile:<br /><p /></li>
<li>Modify the answer to the previous question such that it is sort by the first column:<br /><p /></li>
<li>Modify the answer to the previous question such that all duplicates are removed:<br /><p /></li>
<li>Now, use the <span class='unix'>wc</span> command to determine how many lines of data are produced:<br /><p /></li>
<li>Now, use the <span class='unix'>wc</span> command to print ONLY  the number of lines of data are produced:<br /><p /></li>
<li>How many lines of data were produced?</li>
<li>Show the command to find all files on the system which are sockets (type s): <br /><p /></li>
<li>Show the command to find all files on the system owned by user <span class='unix'>jeremy</span>:<br /><p /></li>
<li>Alter the above question so that all error messages are discarded:<br /><p /></li>
<li>Alter the answer from the previous question so that the results are redirected into the file /tmp/jeremy.out: <br /><p /></li>
<li>Alter the answer from the previous question so that all error messages are redirected into the file /tmp/jeremy.err:<br /><p /></li>
