<li>What file contains the passwords that <span class='unix'>john</span> has already broken?<br /><p/></li>
<p>What is John the ripper?  A password cracker for Unix-based systems.  Given a copy of the shadow password file, it attempts to determine all the passwords for all the users.  It takes a variable amount of time, sometimes just a few seconds, sometimes several weeks.  Documentation on how to install and run John the ripper is included in the tarball.  I recommend reading the contents of files with names such as README and INSTALL.</p>
